                        <p class="lead">The story of Prophet Isa (Jesus, عليه السلام), the son of Maryam, holds a uniquely revered status in Islam. Mentioned by name more often in the Quran than Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), his life is a magnificent sign of Allah's limitless power. He is the Messiah, the Word of Allah, and a spirit from Him, born miraculously without a father. His story stands as a clear testament against those who denied him and those who exaggerated his status, clarifying his true role as a noble Messenger of Allah sent to the Children of Israel.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 1: A Vow to the Lord</h2>
                        <p>The story of Prophet Isa begins with his blessed mother, Maryam (Mary). She descended from the pious family of Imran, a lineage chosen and honored by Allah above all others. Maryam's mother, Hannah, was a righteous woman who was unable to bear children. One day, her heart filled with longing, she made a heartfelt prayer to Allah, vowing that if she were blessed with a child, she would dedicate it entirely to His service at the holy temple, Bait al-Maqdis.</p>
                        
                        <p>Allah, the All-Hearer, answered her prayer. When Hannah gave birth, she was surprised to have a daughter, as only males traditionally served in the temple. Yet she remained firm in her vow, saying, <strong>"My Lord! I have delivered a female... And I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast."</strong> (Quran 3:36). Allah accepted her offering with a "goodly acceptance" and caused Maryam to grow in purity and piety, shielded from the touch of Shaytan.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 2: Glad Tidings from an Angel</h2>
                        <p>Maryam grew up in the care of the Prophet Zakariya, spending her days in seclusion and worship. Allah honored her with miracles; whenever Zakariya entered her chamber, he would find her with sustenance that was out of season. When he asked where it came from, she would reply, "It is from Allah. Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit." (Quran 3:37).</p>

                        <p>One day, as she was in seclusion, a profound event occurred. The Angel Jibril (Gabriel) appeared before her in the form of a perfect man. Terrified, the chaste Maryam cried out, "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah." (Quran 19:18). Jibril reassured her, saying, <strong>"I am only a messenger from your Lord, to announce to you the gift of a righteous son."</strong> (Quran 19:19).</p>

                        <p>Astonished, Maryam asked, "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?" Jibril replied with the divine decree: <strong>"So it will be. Your Lord says, 'That is easy for Me... and We wish to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter already decreed.'"</strong> (Quran 19:21). Then, Jibril blew into her garment, and by the command of Allah—"Be!"—she miraculously conceived.</p>
                        
                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <p>Knowing the accusations she would face from her people, Maryam withdrew to a distant place. When the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree, she cried out in anguish, "Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!" (Quran 19:23). In this moment of intense physical and emotional trial, Allah sent her comfort. A voice, either that of the newborn Isa or Jibril, called out from below her, "Grieve not! Your Lord has provided a water stream before you. And shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you; it will let fall fresh, ripe dates upon you." (Quran 19:24-25).</p>

                        <p>She was instructed to eat, drink, and be comforted, and to vow a fast of silence if she met any person. After some time, she returned to her people, carrying the blessed child in her arms. Immediately, they accosted her with accusations: "O Maryam! Indeed you have brought a thing unheard of! O sister of Harun! Your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother an unchaste woman!" (Quran 19:27-28).</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 4: The First Miracle</h2>
                        <p>Following Allah's command, Maryam remained silent and simply pointed to the infant in her arms. The people were bewildered and scornful, "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" (Quran 19:29). It was then that Allah granted the first of many miracles to His messenger. The baby Isa spoke, with clarity and wisdom far beyond his days, clearing his mother's name and declaring his divine mission:</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            <p class="mb-0"><strong>"Verily, I am a servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet; and He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Salat (prayer) and Zakat, as long as I live. And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblessed. And Salam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!"</strong> (Quran 19:30-33).</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>With these powerful words, he established his true status: not a god, but a humble servant of God. He affirmed his prophethood and acquitted his mother of any wrongdoing, yet many among the people refused to believe, accusing her of sorcery.</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 5: The Messenger to Bani Israel -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 5: Signs and Disciples</h2>
                        <p>When Prophet Isa reached adulthood, Allah sent him as a messenger to the Children of Israel. At that time, they had become masters of medicine and science, so Allah gave Isa miracles that surpassed their worldly knowledge. He would fashion the shape of a bird out of clay, breathe into it, and it would become a living bird by Allah's leave. He healed the one born blind and the leper. Most astonishingly, he would bring the dead back to life, always reminding the people that these acts were only by the permission of Allah.</p>
                        
                        <p>He called his people back to the pure worship of the One God, confirming the truth of the Torah that came before him and giving the glad tidings of a final messenger to come after him, whose name would be Ahmad. He gathered a group of devoted followers, the "Hawariyyun" (Disciples), who declared, "We are the helpers of Allah; we believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims." (Quran 3:52).</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 6: The Plot and the Ascension -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 6: The Plan of Allah</h2>
                        <p>Despite the clear signs, the leaders among the Children of Israel rejected Prophet Isa. Feeling their power threatened by his message of piety and sincerity, they plotted to kill him. They conspired with the Roman authorities to have him arrested and crucified.</p>
                        
                        <p>But their plot was no match for the plan of Allah. The Quran states emphatically: <strong>"And they plotted, and Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners."</strong> (Quran 3:54). As the soldiers closed in, Allah intervened. He did not allow His noble messenger to be killed or humiliated. Instead, Allah raised Prophet Isa, body and soul, up to the heavens. To deceive his enemies, Allah cast the likeness of Isa onto another man—some narrations say it was a volunteer from among his disciples, others say a traitor—who was then arrested and crucified in his place.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Quran is clear and decisive on this matter: <strong>"...But they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it was made to appear to them so... For surely, they killed him not. But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise."</strong> (Quran 4:157-158). Prophet Isa remains alive in the heavens and, as foretold by Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), will return to Earth before the Day of Judgment to defeat the Dajjal (Antichrist), break the cross, and establish justice under the law of Islam.</p>

                                    <strong>Allah's Power is Limitless:</strong> Isa's fatherless birth is a supreme sign that Allah's command "Be!" is all that is needed for anything to come into existence.

                                    <strong>The Honor of Maryam:</strong> The story highlights the high status of pious women in Islam. Maryam's purity, faith, and patience made her worthy of being chosen above all other women.
                                </li>
                                <li class="mb-3">
                                    <strong>The True Status of Isa:</strong> He was a mighty messenger of Allah, not His son. His first words in the cradle were "I am a servant of Allah," establishing his true relationship with his Creator.
                                </li>
                                <li class="mb-3">
                                    <strong>Miracles are by Allah's Will:</strong> All of Isa's astonishing miracles were performed "by the permission of Allah," teaching that all power and ability ultimately come from God.

                                <li>
                                    <strong>The Triumph of Allah's Plan:</strong> The plot to kill Isa failed because Allah's plan is always supreme. It is a lesson that the enemies of truth can never truly harm Allah's chosen messengers.
