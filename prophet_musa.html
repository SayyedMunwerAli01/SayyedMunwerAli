                        <!-- Introduction -->
                        <p class="lead">The story of Prophet Musa (Moses, عليه السلام) is one of the most frequently narrated and detailed accounts in the Holy Quran. It is a powerful saga of a prophet raised in the palace of a tyrant, destined to liberate his people from bondage. His life was marked by incredible miracles, a direct conversation with Allah, and a lifelong struggle against the arrogance of Pharaoh and the stubbornness of his own people. It is a story of divine intervention, immense patience, and the ultimate victory of truth over falsehood.</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 1: The Child in the River -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 1: A Prophecy of Fear, A Plan of Hope</h2>
                        <p>Prophet Musa was born in Egypt during a time of terrible oppression. The Pharaoh, a cruel and arrogant king, had enslaved the Children of Israel (Bani Israel). Haunted by a prophecy that a boy from among them would rise to overthrow his kingdom, Pharaoh issued a horrific decree: every newborn Israelite male was to be killed. It was into this world of fear and persecution that Musa was born.</p>
                        
                        <p>But Allah, the best of planners, had a different design. He inspired Musa's mother with a plan to save her child: <strong>"Put him into a chest, then cast him into the river (Nile), then the river shall cast him up on the bank, and he shall be taken by an enemy to Me and an enemy to him."</strong> (Quran 20:39). With a heart torn between fear and faith, she placed her infant son in a basket and set him adrift on the waters of the Nile, instructing his older sister to follow him from a distance. Allah's promise to her was absolute: <strong>"We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of the Messengers."</strong> (Quran 28:7).</p>
                        
                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <!-- Chapter 2: In the House of the Enemy -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 2: Raised in Pharaoh's Palace</h2>
                        <p>The basket floated down the Nile until, by divine will, it was discovered by the household of the very man who sought to destroy him: Pharaoh. When the child was brought before Pharaoh's wife, her heart was filled with love for him. She pleaded with her husband, <strong>"A comfort of the eye for me and for you. Kill him not, perhaps he may be of benefit to us, or we may adopt him as a son."</strong> (Quran 28:9). Unbeknownst to them, they were adopting the very child who would challenge their tyranny.</p>

                        <p>Allah then orchestrated a beautiful reunion. The infant Musa refused to take milk from any of the Egyptian wet nurses. His sister, who had been watching, approached the family and suggested she could find a nursing mother for him. She led them straight to her own mother. In this way, Allah fulfilled His promise, returning Musa to his mother's arms so that she could nurse her own child, right under the protection of Pharaoh's palace. Musa grew up with the training of a prince but with the faith of his true family, becoming a man of great strength and wisdom.</p>
                        
                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <!-- Chapter 3: Flight to Midian -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 3: An Unintentional Act and an Escape</h2>
                        <p>One day, as a young man, Musa entered the city and saw two men fighting—one an Israelite and the other an Egyptian. The Israelite called out to him for help. In trying to defend his kinsman, Musa struck the Egyptian with his fist, accidentally killing him. He was immediately filled with remorse, praying, <strong>"My Lord, I have wronged my soul, so forgive me."</strong> (Quran 28:16). He knew this was the work of Satan, meant to cause strife.</p>
                        <p>The next day, a man came rushing to Musa, warning him that the chiefs of Pharaoh were plotting to kill him in retaliation. He advised him to flee Egypt immediately. Taking the advice, Musa escaped, heading east towards the land of Midian, praying to Allah to guide him on the right path.</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 4: The Divine Call -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 4: The Fire on the Mountain</h2>
                        <p>After reaching Midian and helping two women water their flocks, Musa was introduced to their father, a righteous old man (believed to be the Prophet Shu'aib). He agreed to work for him for a term of eight to ten years, and eventually married one of his daughters. After fulfilling his term, Musa set out with his family to return to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>On their journey, as they passed Mount Tur, he saw a fire burning in the distance. He told his family to wait while he went to investigate, hoping to bring back a burning brand for warmth. As he approached, a voice called out from a blessed tree on the right side of the valley: <strong>"O Musa! Verily! I am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!"</strong> (Quran 28:30). It was here that Musa was chosen for prophethood.</p>

                        <p>Allah bestowed upon him two great miracles as signs for Pharaoh. He was told to throw down his staff, which turned into a slithering serpent. Then he was told to put his hand into his bosom, and when he drew it out, it shone with a brilliant white light, without any harm. Allah commanded him to go to Pharaoh, who had transgressed all bounds, and to call him to worship the One True God and to free the Children of Israel.</p>

                        <hr class="my-5">
                        
                        <!-- Chapter 5: Confrontation and Miracles -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 5: The Sorcerers and the Signs</h2>
                        <p>Musa, accompanied by his brother Harun (Aaron), whom Allah had appointed as a prophet to support him, went before Pharaoh. They delivered their message, but the arrogant king mocked them and demanded a sign. When Musa showed his miracles, Pharaoh accused him of being a magician and challenged him to a contest against the best sorcerers in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>On the day of the festival, the sorcerers cast their ropes and staffs, and by their magic, they appeared to the people as moving snakes. But when Musa cast his staff, it turned into a real serpent and swallowed all of their illusions. The sorcerers, recognizing a divine power far beyond their own tricks, immediately fell down in prostration, declaring, <strong>"We believe in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Musa and Harun."</strong> (Quran 26:47-48). Enraged, Pharaoh threatened them with torture and death, but their newfound faith was unshakeable.</p>
                        <p>Despite this clear sign, Pharaoh and his people persisted in their disbelief. So Allah sent upon them a series of clear punishments: a great storm, swarms of locusts that devoured their crops, infestations of lice, plagues of frogs, and the water of the Nile turning to blood. Each time a plague befell them, they would beg Musa to pray to his Lord to remove it, promising to believe and let the Israelites go. But each time the punishment was lifted, they broke their promise.</p>

                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <!-- Chapter 6: The Exodus -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 6: The Parting of the Sea</h2>
                        <p>Finally, Allah commanded Musa to lead the Children of Israel out of Egypt by night. When Pharaoh discovered they had gone, he amassed his mighty army and pursued them. The Israelites marched until they reached the edge of the Red Sea, with Pharaoh's army closing in behind them. Trapped between the sea and the enemy, the people cried out in fear, "We are surely overtaken!"</p>
                        <p>But Musa, with absolute faith, replied, <strong>"Nay, verily! With me is my Lord, He will guide me."</strong> (Quran 26:62). At that moment, Allah commanded Musa to strike the sea with his staff. When he did, the sea miraculously parted, creating a dry path in the seabed, with the water standing like huge walls on either side. The Israelites hurried across to safety.</p>
                        <p>Pharaoh and his army, blinded by their arrogance, charged into the dry path in pursuit. But once all of them were within the parted sea, Allah commanded the waters to return. The great walls of water crashed down, drowning Pharaoh and his entire army. In his final moments, as the waves consumed him, Pharaoh declared, <strong>"I believe that there is no God but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who submit."</strong> (Quran 10:90). But it was too late. His repentance was not accepted, though his body was preserved as a sign for future generations.</p>
