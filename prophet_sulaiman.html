                        <!-- Introduction -->
                        <p class="lead">Prophet Sulayman (Solomon, عليه السلام), the son of Prophet Dawood, inherited not worldly riches, but prophethood and wisdom. He prayed to Allah for a kingdom that would be unlike any other, and Allah granted his prayer. His reign was a magnificent display of divine power, a kingdom where not only men, but also the Jinn, the wind, and even birds and animals were under his command. His story is a profound lesson in power, gratitude, wisdom, and the ultimate reality that all might and dominion belong to Allah alone.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 1: A Kingdom Beyond Imagination</h2>
                        <p>Allah blessed Prophet Sulayman with miracles that set his kingdom apart from all others. He was taught the languages of the animals, allowing him to communicate with birds and even understand the silent speech of ants. The Quran recounts the famous story of when his mighty army was marching, and they approached a valley of ants. Sulayman overheard the ant queen warning her colony: <strong>"O ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Sulayman and his hosts crush you, while they perceive not."</strong> (Quran 27:18). Hearing this, Sulayman smiled, and in his gratitude, he prayed to Allah to thank Him for this unique blessing.</p>

                        <p>His command extended beyond the animal kingdom. The fierce winds were made subservient to him, carrying him and his armies across vast distances in a single day. The Jinn, powerful unseen beings, were also placed under his control. They worked for him, building magnificent structures, diving deep into the seas for treasures, and performing tasks that were beyond human capability. His armies were vast and perfectly disciplined, comprising men, Jinn, and birds, all marching in perfect order under his command.</p>
                        
                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <!-- Chapter 2: The Hoopoe and the Queen of Sheba -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 2: A Messenger with Sure News</h2>
                        <p>One day, while inspecting his army of birds, Prophet Sulayman noticed the absence of the Hoopoe. "How is it that I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absent? I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me a clear authority." (Quran 27:20-21). The king’s discipline was firm, and every member of his kingdom was accountable.</p>

                        <p>But the Hoopoe soon returned with a remarkable tale. He said, "I have encompassed that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with sure news. Indeed, I found there a woman ruling over them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah." (Quran 27:22-24). The Hoopoe, a mere bird, was distressed that a nation so blessed would commit the gravest sin of shirk (associating partners with Allah).</p>

                        <p>Intrigued, Sulayman sent the Hoopoe back with a letter to the Queen of Sheba (known as Bilqis), inviting her and her people to submit to the One True God. The Queen, after consulting her advisors, decided to test Sulayman by sending him magnificent gifts, hoping to appease him with wealth. But Sulayman, a Prophet of Allah, rejected the worldly treasures. He sent her messenger back with a stern warning: "Return to them, for we will surely come to them with hosts that they will be unable to resist, and we will expel them therefrom in disgrace, and they will be humbled." (Quran 27:37).</p>
                        
                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <!-- Chapter 3: The Miraculous Throne -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 3: The Submission of a Queen</h2>
                        <p>Realizing the futility of resistance against such a divinely supported king, the Queen of Sheba decided to travel to Jerusalem to submit in person. When Sulayman learned of her journey, he wished to show her a miracle that would prove the truth of his message beyond any doubt. He turned to his assembly of Jinn and men and asked, "Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?" (Quran 27:38).</p>

                        <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1zDQIR8IWzBQ_cupNWIdX8bEOtm4CIldQ" alt="An ornate, empty throne in a grand hall" class="content-page-image float-start me-4 mb-3">

                        <p>A powerful Ifrit from among the Jinn offered to bring it before the king could rise from his council. But one who had knowledge of the Scripture said, "I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye." And in an instant, the magnificent throne of Sheba stood before Sulayman. When the Queen finally arrived and was shown her throne, she was astonished. "Is your throne like this?" she was asked. She replied, "It is as though it were the very one."</p>

                        <p>She was then invited into a grand palace, whose floor was made of polished glass so clear that she mistook it for a pool of water and lifted her skirts to cross it. This final display of power and sophistication, which was far beyond anything she had ever known, overwhelmed her. She recognized the truth and declared her submission to Allah: <strong>"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Sulayman to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."</strong> (Quran 27:44).</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 4: The Wisdom of Sulayman -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 4: The Case of the Two Mothers</h2>
                        <p>Prophet Sulayman's wisdom was as legendary as his power. He inherited his father's keen sense of justice. A famous case, which occurred during the time of Prophet Dawood, demonstrates his incredible insight. Two women came for judgment, each with a baby boy. A wolf had snatched one of the babies, and now both mothers claimed the surviving child as their own.</p>

                        <p>Prophet Dawood, after hearing their arguments, ruled in favor of the elder woman. As they were leaving, they passed by the young Sulayman. He called out, "Bring me a knife that I may cut the child in two and give half to each of you." The elder woman remained silent, but the younger one, the true mother, cried out in horror, "No, may Allah have mercy on you! It is her son!" Her maternal love could not bear the thought of her child being harmed, even if it meant giving him up. Upon seeing this selfless display of love, Sulayman immediately knew the truth and awarded the child to the younger woman. His wisdom, a gift from Allah, saw through the dispute to the heart of the matter.</p>
                        
                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <!-- Chapter 5: The Passing of a Prophet -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 5: A Silent Death, A Powerful Lesson</h2>
                        <p>The death of Prophet Sulayman was as miraculous as his life. He was overseeing the Jinn as they toiled on a great construction project. To ensure they continued their work without pause, he stood watching them, leaning on his staff. It was in this very position that the Angel of Death came and took his soul.</p>

                        <p>His lifeless body remained standing, perfectly balanced on his staff, for a long time—some narrations say for as long as a year. The Jinn, fearing their master's watchful eye, did not dare to slacken their efforts. They continued their hard labor, completely unaware that the great king was no longer alive. They believed they knew the unseen, but Allah planned to teach them a powerful lesson in humility.</p>

                        <p>Finally, a tiny creature of the earth, a termite, began to gnaw at the base of the wooden staff. Day by day, it ate away at the wood until, hollowed out, the staff could no longer support the king's body. It gave way, and the body of Prophet Sulayman fell to the ground. Only then did the Jinn realize their master had been dead all along. The Quran concludes the story: <strong>"And when We decreed for him death, nothing indicated to them his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff. But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment."</strong> (Quran 34:14).</p>

                                    <strong>All Power Belongs to Allah:</strong> Sulayman's incredible kingdom was a direct gift from Allah. It teaches us that all power, authority, and control are from Him alone, and He grants them to whom He wills.

                                    <strong>Gratitude for Blessings:</strong> Despite his immense power, Sulayman was constantly turning to Allah in gratitude. His story is a powerful reminder to always be thankful for the blessings we have been given, big or small.

                                    <strong>Wisdom over Force:</strong> Sulayman used his wisdom to invite the Queen of Sheba to Islam, not just his mighty army. True victory lies in winning hearts and minds with truth and reason.

                                    <strong>The Limit of Knowledge:</strong> The story of his death is a profound lesson that no one knows the unseen except Allah. Even the powerful Jinn were humbled by this reality.
