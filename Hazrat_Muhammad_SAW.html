                        <!-- Introduction -->
                        <p class="lead">The story of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) is the final chapter in Allah's long history of guidance to humanity. It begins nearly four thousand years after his ancestor, Prophet Ibrahim, first rejected the idols of his people. The world had again fallen into darkness, and the pure faith of Ibrahim was all but lost. It was into this world that Allah sent his final messenger, an orphan from the noble tribe of Quraysh, to restore the truth, unite humanity, and deliver the final, perfect, and eternal message for all time: the Holy Quran.</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 1: The Noble Lineage -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 1: The Children of Ismail</h2>
                        <p>The lineage of the Prophet (ﷺ) traces back to Ismail, the first son of Ibrahim. As commanded by Allah, Ibrahim left Ismail and his mother Hajar in the barren valley of Makkah. It was here that Allah miraculously brought forth the well of Zamzam, and it was here that Ibrahim and Ismail rebuilt the Ka’bah, the first house of worship dedicated to the One God. From Ismail's descendants came the tribe of Quraysh, who became the custodians of the Ka’bah.</p>
                        <p>As time passed, the Arabs strayed from the monotheistic path. They brought idols from their travels and placed them in the holy sanctuary, and the well of Zamzam was buried and forgotten. Yet, the honor of the Prophet's family line remained. His great-grandfather, Hashim, established the great caravan journeys that made Makkah a prosperous center of trade. His grandfather, ‘Abd al-Muttalib, was the respected leader who rediscovered Zamzam. His father, ‘Abd Allah, was known for his piety and nobility, and his mother, Aminah, was from the finest family of Quraysh. It was through this pure and honored lineage that Allah chose to send His final Prophet.</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 2: The Year of the Elephant -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 2: The Year of the Elephant</h2>
                        <p>In 570 A.D., the year of the Prophet’s birth, a tyrannical Abyssinian ruler named Abrahah marched on Makkah. He intended to destroy the Ka’bah to divert the pilgrimage to his own grand church in Yemen. His army was led by a fearsome elephant. The people of Makkah were terrified, but their leader, ‘Abd al-Muttalib, placed his trust in the Lord of the House. As Abrahah's army advanced, the elephant refused to move towards the Ka’bah. Then, Allah sent flocks of birds from the sea, which pelted the army with stones of baked clay, annihilating them completely. This miraculous event, known as the 'Year of the Elephant', demonstrated the sanctity of the Ka’bah and foreshadowed the birth of the one who would purify it forever.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 3: The Praised One is Born</h2>
                        <p>On the twelfth day of Rabi al-Awwal in that same year, Aminah gave birth to her son. Born an orphan, as his father had passed away on a trading journey, he was named Muhammad (ﷺ), 'the Praised One', a name foretold to his mother. He was sent to live his early years in the wholesome desert environment with a wet-nurse named Halimah from the tribe of Bani Sa'd. Though Halimah was poor, her household was filled with blessings from the moment the child arrived. Her flocks flourished and her fortunes changed. It was during this time that two angels came to the young Muhammad (ﷺ), opened his chest, and washed his heart with snow, purifying it for the great mission that lay ahead.</p>
                        <p>He returned to Makkah a strong and healthy boy, but his trials were not over. At the age of six, his mother Aminah passed away, leaving him an orphan twice over. His loving grandfather, ‘Abd al-Muttalib, took him in, but he too died just two years later. The young orphan was then placed in the care of his uncle, Abu Talib, who loved him dearly and protected him as his own.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 4: The Trustworthy Youth</h2>
                        <p>As Muhammad (ﷺ) grew into manhood, his character shone brightly in a society plagued by vice. He was renowned for his truthfulness, integrity, and kindness, earning the universal title of "Al-Amin", the Trustworthy. He never worshipped the idols of his people and was deeply troubled by their ways. He found solace in seclusion, often retreating to a cave on Mount Hira to contemplate the Creator.</p>
                        <p>A wealthy and respected widow named Khadijah, hearing of his impeccable reputation, hired him to manage her trade caravan to Syria. He returned with unprecedented profits, but it was his character that truly impressed her. Khadijah, who had refused many proposals from the chiefs of Quraysh, sent a friend to propose marriage to him. Their marriage was a blessed and happy one, and she would become his greatest source of support and comfort.</p>

                        <!-- Chapter 5: The First Revelation -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 5: The Coming of the Archangel Gabriel</h2>
                        <p>In his fortieth year, during his customary retreat in the month of Ramadan, the divine call came. The Archangel Jibril appeared before him in the cave of Hira and commanded him, "Read!" Being unlettered, the Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I cannot read." Jibril seized him and pressed him tightly three times, each time repeating the command. After the third time, Jibril recited the first verses of the Quran: <strong>"Read: In the Name of thy Lord who createth, Createth man from a clot. Read: And thy Lord is the Most Generous Who teacheth by the pen, Teacheth man that which he knew not."</strong> (Quran 96:1-5).</p>
                        <p>He rushed home, terrified and trembling, to his wife Khadijah. She wrapped him in blankets and comforted him with words that cemented her place as the first believer: "Be happy... Truly I swear by Allah who has my soul in His hands, that you will be our people's Prophet."</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 6: The First Believers and the Open Call</h2>
                        <p>For three years, the message was shared in secret. Khadijah was the first to accept Islam. She was followed by the Prophet's young cousin ‘Ali, his freed slave Zayd, and his closest friend, the noble merchant Abu Bakr. Through Abu Bakr, other respected men like ‘Uthman and Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas came to Islam. They would meet secretly in the mountains to learn and pray.</p>
                        <p>Then Allah commanded him to preach openly. The Prophet (ﷺ) climbed the hill of Safa and called the clans of Quraysh. After confirming his lifelong truthfulness, he warned them of a great punishment and invited them to the worship of Allah alone. His call was met with scorn, led by his own uncle, Abu Lahab, marking the beginning of a long and bitter persecution.</p>

                        <hr class="my-5">
                        
                        <!-- Chapter 7: The Migration to Abyssinia -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 7: The King Who Believed</h2>
                        <p>As the persecution of the Muslims intensified, the Prophet (ﷺ) advised a group of his followers to seek refuge in Abyssinia, a Christian kingdom ruled by a just king, the Negus. The Quraysh, furious at their escape, sent two envoys with lavish gifts to demand their return. The Negus summoned the Muslims to his court. Their spokesman, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, eloquently explained the message of Islam and recited the verses from the Quran about Prophet Isa and his mother Maryam. The king and his bishops wept, recognizing the divine source of the revelation. He granted the Muslims protection and sent the Quraysh envoys back in disgrace.</p>

                        <hr class="my-5">

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 8: The Cruelty of Quraysh</h2>
                        <p>The conversion of strong men like Hamzah, the Prophet's uncle, and the courageous ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, strengthened the Muslims. Alarmed, the Quraysh imposed a complete social and economic boycott on the Prophet (ﷺ) and his clan, the Bani Hashim. For three agonizing years, they were isolated in a valley, cut off from all supplies. They suffered from extreme hunger, their cries heard across the valley. Yet, their faith did not waver. The boycott finally ended when some conscientious members of Quraysh grew ashamed of their cruelty and, miraculously, found the declaration document inside the Ka’bah had been eaten by termites, all except for the words, 'In Your Name, O Allah'.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Chapter 9: The Year of Sorrow</h2>
                        <p>Shortly after the boycott ended, the Prophet (ﷺ) faced two profound losses in the same year. His beloved wife Khadijah, his comfort and support for 25 years, passed away. Soon after, his uncle and protector, Abu Talib, also died. With their deaths, the persecution from Quraysh intensified, now without any restraint. Feeling that Makkah's heart was closed, the Prophet (ﷺ) traveled to the nearby city of Ta'if, hoping to find support. Instead, he was met with mockery and violence. The leaders set their slaves and children upon him, pelting him with stones until his feet bled. Wounded and dejected, he took refuge in a garden and offered a beautiful, heartfelt prayer to Allah, complaining only of his own weakness. His journey was not in vain, for a Christian servant named 'Addas recognized him as a Prophet and accepted Islam.</p>

                        <p>In this difficult time, Allah bestowed upon His Prophet (ﷺ) a miraculous honor: the Isra and Mi'raj. In a single night, he was transported from Makkah to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. There, he led all the preceding prophets in prayer. From Jerusalem, he ascended through the seven heavens, meeting prophets at each level, until he reached the Divine Presence. It was here that the five daily prayers, the cornerstone of a Muslim's faith, were enjoined upon the community.</p>

                        <p>The message of Islam began to find fertile ground in the northern city of Yathrib. During the annual pilgrimage, men from the tribes of Aws and Khazraj met the Prophet (ﷺ) and secretly pledged their allegiance to him, inviting the Muslims to their city. This was the turning point. The Prophet (ﷺ) instructed his followers to migrate. The Quraysh, learning of this, hatched a final, desperate plot to assassinate him. But Allah protected His Messenger. As the assassins surrounded his house, he slipped away, leaving ‘Ali in his bed. He and Abu Bakr journeyed north, hiding for three days in the Cave of Thawr, where Allah's protection was manifest in a spider's web and a nesting dove that convinced their pursuers the cave was empty. This migration, the Hijrah, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar and the dawn of the first Islamic state.</p>

                        <p>In Madinah (formerly Yathrib), the Prophet (ﷺ) forged a community of faith, uniting the Emigrants from Makkah (Muhajirun) and the Helpers of Madinah (Ansar). But the Quraysh would not leave them in peace. The first major confrontation was the Battle of Badr. With just over 300 men, the Muslims, aided by angels sent by Allah, defeated a mighty Quraysh army of a thousand. A year later, seeking revenge, the Quraysh met the Muslims at the Battle of Uhud. The Muslims were on the verge of victory until a group of archers disobeyed a direct order from the Prophet (ﷺ), leading to a reversal and a harsh lesson in the cost of disobedience. The final major assault on Madinah came in the Battle of the Trench, where a confederate army of 10,00D besieged the city. The Muslims, outnumbered, defended themselves by digging a massive trench. After a month, a divine storm destroyed the enemy camp, securing a decisive victory for Islam.</p>

                        <p>Years of struggle culminated in the Prophet (ﷺ) marching on Makkah with an army of 10,000. He took the city without bloodshed. He who was exiled, whose followers were murdered, stood as a conqueror before his bitterest enemies. "What do you think I will do to you?" he asked. "You are a noble brother," they replied. In an act of unparalleled magnanimity, he declared, "Go, you are all free." He then entered the Ka’bah and purified it, destroying the 360 idols and rededicating the House to the worship of the One True God, fulfilling the prayer of his ancestor Ibrahim.</p>

                        <p>In the tenth year of the Hijrah, the Prophet (ﷺ) led over 100,000 Muslims in the Hajj. On the Plain of 'Arafah, he delivered his Farewell Sermon, a profound charter for all humanity. He proclaimed the universal brotherhood of mankind, the sanctity of life and property, the rights of women, and the foundation of an equitable society. It was on this day that Allah revealed the final verse of revelation: "This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion." (Quran 5:3). His mission was complete.</p>

                        <p>Shortly after returning to Madinah, the Prophet (ﷺ) fell ill. As his fever worsened, he appointed his dearest friend, Abu Bakr, to lead the prayers. On Monday, the 12th of Rabi al-Awwal, in the 11th year of the Hijrah, while resting in the lap of his wife 'Aishah, his soul returned to its Lord. His last words were, "Nay, rather the Exalted Communion of Paradise." The light of Prophethood had passed from the earth, but the light of his message—the Holy Quran and his exemplary life (the Sunnah)—would remain to illuminate the world forever.</p>

                                    <strong>The Final Message:</strong> He delivered the Quran, Allah's final and preserved revelation, and his life (the Sunnah) serves as the perfect practical example for all of humanity to follow until the end of time.
